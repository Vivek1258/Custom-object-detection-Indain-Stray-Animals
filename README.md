## Project Overview

In this project, I have developed and deployed  a custom object detection model that can be used to detect stray animals (cow and dogs ). The dataset is created by taking custom images from google image search. The Machine Learning Model is developed, trained, and deployed(as a REST API ) on Heroku Cloud using Python-Flask. The client application can make

## Algothrim


## DataSet

### Data Collection:
Various images of cows and dogs are collected from Google Image search under [creative common lisences](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/29508?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid). 

### Data Lebeling:

#### lebaling tool : [makesence.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/)

#### YOLO format:   one *.txt file per image (if no objects in image, no *.txt file is required). 

### The *.txt file specifications are:

- One row per object
- Each row is class x_center y_center width height format.
- Box coordinates must be in normalized xywh format (from 0 - 1). {If your boxes are in pixels, divide x_center and width by image width, and y_center and height by image height.}
- Class numbers are zero-indexed (start from 0).

## Built With
